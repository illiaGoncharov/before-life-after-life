The\n        installation features 5 screens each representing an image sequence\n        built on excerpts from personal photographic archives of contributors.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        By building multiple custom image-generative models trained on submitted\n        archives of four participants and myself, I speculated on personal\n        events and pressing social issues, intentionally blurring the line\n        between the real and the hypothetical. With prompts covering life’s\n        stages—from childhood and relationships to society, politics, and\n        beyond—the resulting sequences offer familiar but powerfully challenging\n        visions of human experience. Popular AI often avoids controversial or\n        triggering visuals, but integrating personal archives uncovers what is\n        typically hidden, creating compelling contrasts where digital “glitches”\n        signal moments of controversy both for the algorithms and for us.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        These glitches become even more telling when the models, shaped by\n        relatively moderated imagery, encounter content that is raw, unfiltered,\n        and difficult to lable. They expose not just technical shortcomings but\n        also the social and emotional blind spots of our increasingly AI-driven\n        world—like when a prompt referencing intimacy or sexuality yields\n        fractured, formless bodies. Taken individually or in comparison, each\n        sequence sparks a dialogue on how we recount our past and engage with\n        current realities. Ultimately, the project suggests that the true\n        potency of AI technologies applied to archives lies not in seamless\n        mimicking of reality, but in its ability to illuminate hidden layers of\n        our personal and collective histories.\n      </p>\n\n      {/* Изображение с отступом */}\n      <div className=\"about-image-container\">\n        <img\n          className=\"about-image\"\n          src={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/images/about.jpg`}\n          alt=\"About the project\"\n        />\n        <p className=\"image-caption\">\n          5-channel video installation <br /> \n          displayed on five screens, each <br /> \n          mounted on identical tripods\n        </p>\n      </div>\n\n      <p>\n        Andrey Lopatin is a Russian-born artist currently based in Lausanne,\n        where he is pursuing a Master’s degree in Photography at ECAL.
