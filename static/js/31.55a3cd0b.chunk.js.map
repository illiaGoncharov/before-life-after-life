The\n        installation features 5 screens each representing an image sequence\n        built on excerpts from personal photographic archives of contributors.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        By building multiple custom image-generative models trained on submitted\n        archives of four participants and myself, I speculated on personal\n        events and pressing social issues, intentionally blurring the line\n        between the real and the hypothetical. With prompts covering life’s\n        stages—from childhood and relationships to society, politics, and\n        beyond—the resulting sequences offer familiar but powerfully challenging\n        visions of human experience. Popular AI often avoids controversial or\n        triggering visuals, but integrating personal archives uncovers what is\n        typically hidden, creating compelling contrasts where digital “glitches”\n        signal moments of controversy both for the algorithms and for us.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        These glitches become even more telling when the models, shaped by\n        relatively moderated imagery, encounter content that is raw, unfiltered,\n        and difficult to lable. They expose not just technical shortcomings but\n        also the social and emotional blind spots of our increasingly AI-driven\n        world—like when a prompt referencing intimacy or sexuality yields\n        fractured, formless bodies. Taken individually or in comparison, each\n        sequence sparks a dialogue on how we recount our past and engage with\n        current realities. Ultimately, the project suggests that the true\n        potency of AI technologies applied to archives lies not in seamless\n        mimicking of reality, but in its ability to illuminate hidden layers of\n        our personal and collective histories.\n      </p>\n\n      {/* Изображение с отступом */}\n      <div className=\"about-image-container\">\n        <img\n          className=\"about-image\"\n          src={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/images/about.jpg`}\n        />\n        <p className=\"image-caption\">\n          5-channel video installation <br /> \n          displayed on five screens, each <br /> \n          mounted on identical tripods\n        </p>\n      </div>\n\n      <p>\n        Andrey Lopatin is a Russian-born artist currently based in Lausanne,\n        where he is pursuing a Master’s degree in Photography at ECAL. He holds\n        a Bachelor’s degree in Cultural Studies from HSE in Moscow, where he\n        first became captivated by the interplay between visual media and\n        emerging technologies—an interest that evolved to encompass artificial\n        and other non-human intelligences, digital capitalism, and human\n        responses to technological innovation. Grounded in active\n        experimentation with cutting-edge tools, his practice explores the\n        social and personal reverberations such technologies produce, shedding\n        light on the ever-evolving terrain between human agency and\n        machine-driven processes.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        _ <br />\n        _ <br />\n        _ <br />\n        _ <br />\n        _ <br />\n        _ <br />\n        _ <br />\n        _ <br />\n        _ <br />\n        {/* Thanks to: <br />\n        _ <br />\n        Thomas Livugu Ngolyo <br />\n        Daniel Hernandez Ferrer <br />\n        Brighton <br />\n        Antonica <br />\n        Fernando <br />\n        Ken ken <br />\n        bereket <br />\n        Zara <br />\n        Pat Springer <br />\n        trantuan <br />\n        Javier Rengel <br />\n        Ken ADAMU UWESU MBINDIMBI Franco Sherwin Ana Q.
